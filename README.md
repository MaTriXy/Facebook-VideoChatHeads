# VideoChatHeads

Why this repo?
--------------

This repo enables you to show videos instead of usual profile picture for chat heads. Inspired from Facebook's Video profile picture, I decided to replicate its implementation to show videos in profile picture and to create chat heads for the same.

> **Note:** This repo is a custom implementation for VideoChatHeads. Any kinds of suggestions or pull request are welcome and appreciated.
